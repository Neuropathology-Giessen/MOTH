=================================
Welcome to MOTHI's documentation!
=================================

| mothi (**M**\emory-efficient **O**\n-the-fly **T**\iling of **H**\istological **I**\mages using QuPath)
  is a `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ library
  that extends the funcionality of `paquo <https://github.com/bayer-science-for-a-better-life/paquo>`_.
| Now tiling can be done on-the-fly with mothi
  and a Python developer no longer needs a Groovy script to generate tiles.
| To quickly start using mothi effectively, it's best to take a look at the :ref:`quickstart` and the :ref:`api`
